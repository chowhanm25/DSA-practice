# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

## 📌 Problem Statement

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`th day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing:

- A single day to buy one stock
- A different future day to sell that stock

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction.  
If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

---

## 🧠 Approach

This problem can be solved efficiently using a **single pass traversal**.

### Key Idea

- Track the **minimum price seen so far**.
- At each day:
  - Calculate the potential profit if selling on that day.
  - Update the maximum profit accordingly.

We ensure:
- Buy happens before sell.
- Only one transaction is allowed.

## 💡 Algorithm

1. Initialize:
   - `min_price` as infinity
   - `max_profit` as 0

2. Iterate through the array:
   - Update `min_price` if current price is smaller.
   - Compute `current_profit = price - min_price`.
   - Update `max_profit` if `current_profit` is larger.

3. Return `max_profit`.

## 🧾 Python Implementation

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        min_price = float('inf')
        max_profit = 0
        
        for price in prices:
            min_price = min(min_price, price)
            max_profit = max(max_profit, price - min_price)
        
        return max_profit
